**Title:** I built an iOS SSH terminal with local AI command conversion (100% free, open source)

**Body:**
Hey everyone! I just released SSHTerminal, an iOS SSH client with a unique twist: AI-powered command conversion.

**What makes it different:**
- 🤖 Type natural language, get bash commands (e.g., "show disk space" → `df -h`)
- 💰 Completely free (vs Termius $100/yr)
- 🔓 MIT licensed open source
- 🧠 Uses local Ollama (no API costs, private)
- ✅ Proper PTY integration with SwiftTerm

**Tech Stack:**
- Swift 5.9
- SwiftTerm for terminal emulation
- Citadel for SSH (forked to expose PTY APIs)
- Ollama with DeepSeek Coder 6.7B

**Why I built it:**
I was tired of paying $100/year for Termius and wanted to experiment with local AI. Figured others might find it useful too.

**Try it:** https://github.com/heyfinal/SSHTerminal

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation!

### r/commandline
```markdown
**Title:** Made an iOS SSH app that converts natural language to bash commands (free, local AI)

**Body:**
Tired of Googling bash syntax on your phone? I built SSHTerminal to help.

**How it works:**
1. Type "show me network config"
2. Local AI converts it to `ip addr show`
3. Command executes
4. You learn as you go

Uses Ollama (local LLM) so it's:
- ✅ 100% free
- ✅ Private (no cloud)
- ✅ Fast (~1-2 sec)
- ✅ Works offline

Open source on GitHub: https://github.com/heyfinal/SSHTerminal

Feedback welcome!
```

### r/sysadmin
```markdown
**Title:** Free iOS SSH terminal with AI that converts plain English to commands

**Body:**
For those times you need to SSH from your phone but can't remember the exact syntax.

SSHTerminal features:
- Natural language → bash commands
- Free alternative to Termius ($100/yr)
- Local AI (Ollama) - no cloud, no API keys
- Open source (MIT)
- Proper terminal emulation (PTY + SwiftTerm)

Example:

## 🔷 LinkedIn Post

```markdown
Excited to announce SSHTerminal - a free, open-source iOS SSH client with integrated AI! 🚀

As someone who frequently needs to SSH into servers from mobile, I was frustrated with expensive apps and memorizing command syntax. So I built a solution.

**Key Features:**
✅ AI command conversion (natural language → bash)
✅ 100% free (vs. Termius at $100/year)
✅ Local AI processing with Ollama
✅ Fully open source (MIT license)
✅ Modern Swift 5.9 codebase

**The Problem:**
Mobile SSH clients are either expensive ($100/yr) or lacking features. Plus, remembering exact bash syntax on a small screen is painful.

**The Solution:**
Type "show disk space" and the AI converts it to `df -h`. Learn as you go, without switching apps to Google syntax.

Perfect for:
🎯 DevOps engineers on the go
🎯 System administrators
🎯 Students learning Linux
🎯 Anyone managing remote servers

Built with SwiftTerm, Citadel (SSH), and DeepSeek Coder model.

Subject: New Open Source iOS SSH Terminal with AI Features

Hi [Name],

I recently released SSHTerminal, an iOS SSH client that uses local AI to convert natural language into bash commands. I thought your audience might find it interesting.

**What makes it unique:**
- First iOS SSH app with built-in AI command conversion
- Uses Ollama (local LLM) - no cloud, no API costs
- 100% free and open source (MIT license)
- Proper PTY integration with SwiftTerm library

**Example use case:**
A user types "network configuration" and the AI instantly converts it to `ip addr show` and executes it. Great for beginners or anyone who doesn't want to memorize syntax.

**Why I built it:**
Commercial SSH apps cost $15-100, and none have AI features. I wanted something free, private (local AI), and beginner-friendly.

**Technical details:**
- Swift 5.9, iOS 15+
- SwiftTerm for terminal emulation
- Forked Citadel for SSH with PTY support
- DeepSeek Coder 6.7B via Ollama

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/heyfinal/SSHTerminal
- Demo: [Add video if you make one]
- Docs: Full setup guides included

Would you be interested in covering this or sharing with your audience? Happy to provide more details, screenshots, or a demo.

Thanks for your time!
